            <p>Well hello there!</p>
            <p>My name is Kevin Johansson, a 17 year old male studying engineering at a Swedish school know as Teknikum. As you might have been able to gather I quite like math, programming and anything computer related. This site has been made by me! Feel free to explore it's content and learn all about me!</p>
            <h2 class="text-color">A litle something about my school</h2>

            <p>A bit about the school!</p>
            <p> As mentioned earlier the school is called teknikum, it's located in a small city in Sweden called Växjö. The boulding itself is revolves arround a centiral hallway that connects to four corridors, almost like an E shape. There is an entire level underneath the school built to resembel the ground floor. Speeking of witch, There are two connected towers that can be accessed from the ground floor. Teknikum started out as an engineering school but has since branched out. Although Teknikum is still primarely an engineering school, with majorety of it's students studying engineering. An astounding 300 out of about 800 students studying engineering! This school obviously has other programs.</p>
            <p>Oi! guess what!</p>

                <ul><li>In this subject i spend my time learning all about robots. From how they work, to how to code them and every thing inbetween! Currently I'm learning a new code language (STL aka structural text. L probably stands for layout) for robots.</li></ul>
                <li class="list-text-color">Swedish</li>
                <ul><li>In this subject we learn about mostly text, literature and so on. Currently we're working on a debate about wheter or not swedish should be an obligetory language to learn in Finland. </li></ul>

                <li class="list-text-color">Fysik</li>
                <ul><li>We work with task to learn about things related to Fysiks, every once in a while we'll have a labb. The labbs are quite fun and interessting.</li></ul>
                <li class="list-text-color">Maths</li>
                <ul><li>Maths! We're working with math here, I know I give the best descriptions. Now we're working with what I think translates into calculus? whateverit is, it's some hard and advanced stuff</li></ul>
                <li class="list-text-color">PE</li>
