                        <td>Stellaeis is a great game! With about 1000 hours in the game I can safetly say that the replayebilety of the game is great. The gists of the game is that youre an alien race that has just discoverd FTL travle, and now youre ready to claim the stars! How will your galaxy ttur out? A startrek like light future? Or a 40000k like war torn galaxy? Only time will tell.</td>
