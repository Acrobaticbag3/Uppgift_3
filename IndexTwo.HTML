                <td>Stellaeis is a great game! With about 1000 hours in the game I can safetly say that the replayebilety of the game is great. The gists of the game is that youre an alien race that has just discoverd FTL travle, and now youre ready to claim the stars! How will your galaxy ttur out? A startrek like light future? Or a 40000k like war torn galaxy? Only time will tell.</td>

With is taking about 300-500 hour to actually complite the games main objective, get of the Rimwolrd.</td>
                <td>10 / 10. One of the best games I've played in a while, the only game better than this being Stellaris.</td>

        <h4>Miscellaneous activities</h4>
        <p>Here are some miscellaneous things I enjoy doing in my spare time. Hanging out with friends, a fun day/night with the boys allways helps lyft the mood. Listen to music or practice my guitar, as of now I only have an guitar. However I do plan on gett ing an electric 8 string, that way i can play both Rock and Djent. When it comes to the type of music I enjoy to listen to, it veries. I usually find my self listening to mostly Rock, instrumental Metal or Djent, but I do listen to pretty much whatever I think sounds good. Codeing, be it C++, C# or HTML, any language works just fine!</p>
