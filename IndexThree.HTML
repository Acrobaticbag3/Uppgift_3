        <h1 class="text-color">Some implementations from my other projects!</h1>
        <p class="text-color">Over this year I've done a lot of projects to learn html and CSS. On his page you'll get to see some thoes projects! Here is my first ever html project.</p>
        <button id="revealorhide" class="button-reveal-code box" onclick="reveal()">Reveal code</button>
        <img class="img" src="images/first-project.png" alt="">
        <p class="text-color">Pretty isen't it? Well, luckily this task wasn't bssed on design. The entire point with this task was to familiarise yourself with HTML and CSS. Just an introduction to coding.</p>
        <p class="text-color">The next project we did was actually a two part project, this project was more centered twords CSS. Part one (a), our task was to create a table with some info in it. There were special criteria that had to be part of our tables, sutch as: background coloring and text positioning. This is how my table turned out:</p>
        <button id="revealorhidetwo" class="button-reveal-code box" onclick="revealtwo()">Reveal code</button>
        <p></p>
        <img class="img" src="images/Uppgift2a.png" alt="">
        <p class="text-color">Granted it wasn't hard to design the table since we had to recreate an image. The challenge part of the task was figuring out how the copde should be written. As for the second part of the task (part b), we had to recreate a logo. This is how that turned out:</p>
        <button id="revealorhidethree" class="button-reveal-code box" onclick="revealthree()">Reveal code</button>
        <p></p>
        <img class="img" src="images/Uppgift2b.png" alt="">
        <p>After that was done we spent a couple of weeks on random projects to improve our skills, at the same time we also started to code with Javascript. Here are some of the random things that I did. Do note that two of the buttons will mess upp your UI.</p>
        <!--Experimental stuff-->
        <button class="button-reveal-code" onclick="moveDive()">Click me!</button>  <!--change the class-->
        <button class="button-reveal-code" onclick="randomMath()">Important!</button> <!--change the class-->
